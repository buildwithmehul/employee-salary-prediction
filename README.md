# 🧠 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses supervised machine learning techniques to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50K based on demographic and employment-related features.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given a dataset containing attributes like age, education level, occupation, and working hours, the task is to build a classification model that can predict whether a person earns:

- `<=50K`  
- `>50K`

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)
- scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.)
- StandardScaler, LabelEncoder / OneHotEncoder
- joblib (for saving the trained model) *(optional)*
